# LibreGrid 

</div>
  
LibreGrid is an open-source grid placement solution for Roblox. It deals with all the math headaches for you and it is very intuitive and lightweight. 

## Why LibreGrid?
I have been developing my world-building game [Wubby](https://www.roblox.com/games/12519560096/Wubby-TERRAIN-VR) for some time now, and the worst problem I stumbled upon was getting the proper grid calculations when the player had to place down blocks. With this open-source module, I want everyone to have a perfectly calculated, lightweight, and intuitive experience to avoid more people from descending into the rabbit hole I went through.

Every other grid module I found is either very limiting, too complex to use, or just not what I'm looking for. I swear, I would've loved that a module like this existed while I was first developing Wubby.

LibreGrid emulates surface-based placement (like the one that Roblox Studio offers), getting rid of all the math-related headaches that would take coding it yourself. Moreover, it allows for more customizations that developers can modify in real time to their liking. This means that, using LibreGrid, you can achieve a block-placing system (like Minecraft's), or a furniture placement system (2D placement), or a Roblox Studio-like experience. 

This module results from months, if not years, of trial and error whilst developing Wubby.

## Features
- **Very lightweight:** 0 shapecasts, ~100 lines, everything thought with performance in mind.
- **Super intuitive:** Every function is well-documented, every type is specified, and the module only has three functions.
- **Customizable:** Allows for many grid-based systems to be created, ranging from 2D to 3D.

- **Automatically align blocks to tilted surfaces**
- **Allows for custom rotations**
- **Allows for *ANY* grid size, even those with decimals.**
<br>

- **100% open-source and free to use:** No attribution required but it'd be greatly appreciated! :3
- **Strictly typed** to avoid any type errors.
